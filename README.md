Movie booking system in Django

Author - Dmitriy Moskalenko

As part of this project, a clear and convenient level of ticket service in cinemas is being developed.
The goal is to create a platform that will greatly simplify the process of finding and purchasing tickets to watch,
as well as increase the availability of information about current shows and films.

To implement the project, I use the Python programming language and the Django web framework, which will ensure high performance and security of the application.
These technologies will help create a scalable architecture and increase development speed.

Technologies:
1. Python 3.12
2. Django 5.0.6

Installation:
1. Install Python 3.12 (Python installation documentation - https://www.python.org/)
2. Install Django 5.0.6 "pip install Django" (Django installation documentation - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/install/)
   
Website launch:
1. Go to directory (film) "cd film"
2. Create migrations "python manage.py makemigrations"
3. Apply migration "python manage.py migrate"
4. Create a super user "python manage.py createsuperuser"
5. Start the server "python manage.py runserver"
